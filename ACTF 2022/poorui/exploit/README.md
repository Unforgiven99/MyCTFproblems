Key point: loadash prototype pollution, XSS

loadash prototype pollution:

* [loadash prototype pollution](https://www.anquanke.com/post/id/248170)

First, exploit loadash prototype pollution to send image. Then the `attrs` in image message can be eploited to achieve XSS.

note:

* The function `sanitize()` in `js/utils/util.js` deletes `<`, `>`, `\`, `_` special characters in message. So we can't use `__proto__`, but use `constructor.prototype` instead.

* The React framework filters some attrbutes in DOM, we can't add arbitrary attrbute. But if `is` attribute is added, the attribute name of the label will not be checked.
