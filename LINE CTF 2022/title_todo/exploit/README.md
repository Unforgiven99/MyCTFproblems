Key point: XSS, xsleak, Scroll to Text Fragment

* Add the `preload=lazy` attribute of the `<img>` tag through XSS injection of the `img_url` variable. Also, add a lot of garbage data to the `\image` page so that the `<img>` tag is not in the initial viewport. Use a `?unique_id` parameter at the end of each image for each post.
* Send the admin our posts and end with `#:~:text=LINECTF{+character+/`. On a good prediction the text would get highlighted and scroll, and if the prediction was bad then it wouldn't.
* Check the `image?unique_id`, if `X-Cache-Status` is `HIT` then we guessed the right character.
